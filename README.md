# Express Generator + SVG Symbols

This repo is an express generator scaffolding with a barebones SVG symbols addition. It comes with some starter icons in `/public/svg`, but you can rip those out and add your own. We use gulp to watch our `svg` directory and auto-generate new SVG symbols the moment that directory changes.
